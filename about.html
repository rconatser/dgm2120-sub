            <p>
                Oceans Blue Travel Agency began as a family business, established as Utah Valley Travel by Harold Johnson in 1960. David Johnson joined his father in 1973 and purchased the business in 1979. Derick Johnson then responded to his passion for travel when he became the third generation of the Johnson family to serve travelers at Oceans Blue Travel Agency.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 1980s, the acquisition of more than 20 vacation travel agencies, establishing business travel expertise and entering the meetings & incentives area formed the foundation for the business as it is known today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the name has changed and we have experienced tremendous growth, Oceans Blue continues to operate as a family business with a dynamic, energetic and exciting travel culture that delivers travel solutions for our customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The passion to guide travelers to their desired destinations has led Oceans Blue Travel Agency to become one of the top travel companies in the country.
